# javaSnake_POO
This project features an advanced implementation of the classic Snake game, developed in Java using modern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The codebase includes specialized classes for various aspects of the game, such as the core game logic, control strategies, graphical interface, and resource management. Its modular architecture demonstrates clean separation between the game model (`OOPS` package), rendering system (`Graphics` package), and geometric utilities (`Geometrics` package), making it an excellent example of how to structure complex applications using OOP design patterns and principles.
